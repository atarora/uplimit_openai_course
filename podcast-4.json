Oh yeah. Whether you have a few weeks old puppy or a senior who's seen multiple decades, any dog person like us knows the most valuable thing in the world is spending time with your pet. The farmer's dog makes it easy to keep them healthy, which can give you more quality years with them. The farmer's dog makes and delivers fresh, healthy dog food. It's recommended by vets, nutritionally balanced, and made from human-grade ingredients and safe, clean kitchens. It's not kibble, it's not canned goo, it's just real food. Well, and what I love about the farmer's dog is they send the food pre-portion, like specifically for Barnaby, based on his unique nutritional needs, his size, and that makes it easy to make sure that your dog stays at their ideal weight, which is one of the biggest indicators of a full, healthy life for a dog. Plus, he loves it, he comes running, he loves it. Get 50% off your first box at thefarmersdog.com slash happier. That's 50% off your first box at thefarmersdog.com slash happier. [\"Farmers Dog\"] [\"Farmers Dog\"] Hello, we are here for More Happier, a podcast where we get more happier. Hey, Elizabeth. Hi, Grach. Today, we'll talk about something that has surprised me about my daily visits to the Met, and we'll talk about something funny Elizabeth saw on the picket line. But first, Elizabeth, something making us more happier, what is it making you more happier? Well, Grach, I am more happier about a trip I'm about to take with Jack and Adam and Nacho and Daisy. So summer is ending, and Adam and I thought it would be fun to just do a short getaway with the dog. So this is, you know, as my new identity as a dog person, this is not something that ever would have occurred to me for the first several decades, my life. But now I love being with the dogs. And so we found a hotel in Carmel, California that takes dogs, and we also learned Carmel is apparently one of the most dog friendly cities in the country. And it also has a dog beach, and there aren't actually very many dog beaches, there's very few. So we're gonna go to Carmel with the dogs, we're gonna go to the dog beach, you can take the dogs to restaurants, they have like, you know, bags everywhere in the town. So we're just doing a little dog getaway, which is something that I think will make us happier and be an adventure for the Corgis. It's a good example of that idea that you don't notice information floating around in the world until it's relevant to you, and then all of a sudden you notice it. Exactly. I don't remember ever seeing any city described as a particularly dog friendly or a hotel as a dog friendly hotel, but I'm sure that once you're thinking about it, but of course you just do a Google search, I'm sure many, many people wanna do exactly this. Yes, and it's fun because you know, not all dogs I think like to travel as it happens. Ours like being in the car, they don't get car sick, they're quiet enough at hotels. So anyway, I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. I'm very excited about it. I'll report back to you. Barnaby is fine in the car, but he definitely does not want to get into the car. And we get the sense that he is not enjoying it. He's not whimpering or getting sick, but he doesn't seem very happy. Will they eagerly jump into the car? Yes, I mean, one of them can actually jump in, but yes. They're eager to get in the car. I think they associate it not with going to the vet, but with like going somewhere fun. They love looking out the window. So it's a fun thing. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, Barnaby definitely. Yeah, he travels. He's an okay traveler, but it sounds like they're more enthusiastic. Oh, that'll be so fun. I can't wait to hear about that. Yeah, so I'll let you know how it goes. Hopefully it'll all be smooth. Gretchen, what about you? What is making you more happier? Well, you know, I love to read. Sometimes I get a same day book and I love a same day book. And a same day book is when I start and finish a book in the same day. And I just did that. I read The Sundial by Shirley Jackson, which I highly recommend. If you like Shirley Jackson, I was talking to a friend about this, and we both agreed that we liked The Sundial better than The Haunting of Hill House, which is a much more famous novel by Shirley Jackson. And she's a very particular taste. Like you either like that kind of thing or you do not like that kind of thing. Now, sometimes it's sort of like binge watching a TV show. I think sometimes if you read something too quickly, you lose something because there is something about going away and picking something up and maybe sinks in more deeply. But there's also something to be gained with just being immersed in a world and you remember all the connections and all the names. But anyway, for me, there's just a special kind of deliciousness to just sinking into a book and making it all the way through. I mean, and it's hours of reading. So it's not often that I have that kind of time, but when I do, it makes me so happy. Well, here's a question. Was this like, were you laying in bed reading most of the day? Are you reading on the couch? Are you outside? Like where are you doing all this reading? And was it, you just sat down and read through or tell me about it, I'm curious. Well, I did read it in pretty big chunks. I didn't power through the entire thing. Though I did, I once read about some, what book was he reading? Somebody was saying how he was, he picked up a book that was, this is like somebody in the Victorian age or something. He picked up a book from someone's, a friend's mantelpiece and just leaned against it and read it and was reading for so long that when he moved away, his whole arm had gone, had just completely fallen asleep because he'd stood there for so long, just enraptured. So I didn't do it all in one, but I would say I did it in like three or four major chunks. So I was spending hours reading it at a time. And so we rented this house outside of New York City for part of the summer. And I love to read outside on a covered porch and they have a great porch for reading. It's very shaded and it hasn't been, surprisingly in New York City, it hasn't been terribly hot. And I run cold, so I can, I like a much hotter temperature than a lot of people. So I love reading outside. So I've been just lying on an outdoor sofa, reading in the shade, reading the sundial. That does sound like a perfect vacation for you. I couldn't imagine a better vacation for Gretchen Rubin. Well, you would love that too. You love to read. That's your favorite vacation activity. So yes, it felt great. Yes, although I think I've mentioned to you though, that since listening to so many audio books and podcasts, I now have a shorter stamina for reading actual pages. So I need to build up my physical book reading stamina again, because I've noticed that about myself and I don't wanna lose my ability to just sit down and read a book for three hours, which I used to do easily. That's my situation at the moment. Well, the funny thing in my household is both my husband, Jamie and Eleanor are reading it by Stephen King, which is like a thousand pages long. I mean, one is from the library book and one is we just bought it. And it's the most gigantic book that you've ever seen. And so I'm like, who says people won't read long books? Yes. That's true. These are books that you could not read and they are not same day books for anyone. Yes. Well, that's fun. I'm glad you're getting your summer reading. Yes.

All right, Gretchen, we have talked so much about how you started going to the Met every day for your five census project. And you're still going. And my question to you, Gretchen, especially someone who's an upholder and can be rigid in your schedule and feel like you don't have flexibility, is this feeling now like an obligation? Is it something that you love to do? Is it something you wanna do? Or is it just your upholder reflex is making you do it? Are you gonna keep doing it? Like, what's the thinking on your daily visits to the Met? Tell me everything. Well, here's the thing. You're absolutely right. I can definitely be rigid. And once something gets in my schedule, it can be hard to get it out. That's the tightening that upholders can sometimes feel. And I thought going into it, I thought I might feel that way about going to the Met every day. It felt like it might become really burdensome. Though, of course, I'm feeling incredibly lucky that I can go and that I live close enough to walk and all that. I just thought it might start feeling like a lot. Here's the thing. I love it more than ever. It is such a treat. It is just a delight. And it's kind of a mandatory recess. It's just like I leave and I go and I just do whatever I feel like. There's always something to see. I walk around. I'm outside. Every part of it gives me energy and calm and ideas. Like a lot of times I'll get ideas when I'm doing it. And I don't make myself stay long. So if I don't feel like staying, I just go in and go out, which I've done sometimes. But usually I just stay, I'll look at a few things. I'll give myself a little quest. But I think it's recess time. You need to go out for recess. And that's what it is for me. And because I do, because of being in a pole door, I do need to have a thing that's on the calendar just to make sure that it gets done. And so I think it's a really good combination of exercise, going outside, stimulating my senses, having something to do, but also nothing to do. So I love it more all the time. You're also learning a lot, I would imagine. Yes, I am learning a lot. Kind of odd patchy things, but I am learning a lot. I learn a lot of vocabulary. Oh, but here's the thing. Alyssa, I've been meaning to tell you this. So something happened very recently that I absolutely did not expect. I mean, I wouldn't have even known about it. So you know how I always have quotations running through my mind and I'm constantly looking up quotations? Yes, yes. For anyone who doesn't know, yes. If any topic of conversation comes up, you're like, oh, I think Borges has something interesting to say about that. Let me find it. Yeah, yeah. So they're just constantly kind of running through the back of my mind, just chiming in and like these little fragments and phrases and then I'll often go and look them up. And of course, I spend a huge amount of time writing them down. If I find something, I'll put them, I have all these documents that I store them in. So it's a whole process for me. But anyway, and it's just so much part of my life that I hadn't really thought about it as being this soundtrack that I have, which is the soundtrack of just like passages or phrases that are in my head. So this is the thing that just left me flabbergasted. So now I'm starting to have that visually with images from the Met. I've seen images so many times, over and over and over again. And it's not like I remember the name of the painting or the sculpture or whatever, or the artist, but I'll see something and it will echo in my mind. It will just flash through in exactly the same way. For instance, Eleanor has long wavy hair and for Christmas a couple of years ago, our mother gave her this long red velvety robe, like to the ground. And so she had washed her hair a couple of hours before and she had part of it back in a clip. So it was sort of like half gathered on her head and then these long tendrils hanging down on this velvet deep red scarlet robe. And she walks in and I thought, oh my gosh, you're exactly reminding me of a painting. You look exactly like this painting. And it was just flashing in my mind. So I run to the computer, look it up. It was King Lear, Act One, Scene One by Edward Austin Abbey. And I knew exactly where it was. I'm like, it's on the top floor of the American wing. I could see it on the wall and indeed it was in the American wing. And if I can, I'll post a picture of her reenacting it and a picture of the painting. I mean, then when I actually looked at it, the woman in the painting, her hair was in braids. It wasn't exactly the same, but you definitely saw why I made the visual connection, but that had never happened to me. I mean, now it's starting to happen a lot. That is cool. That's a real change. That's like a rewiring of the brain. That's what it feels like. That's exactly what it feels like. It feels like a whole new thing just happened in my head. Well, what's also interesting is I don't think either of us are particularly visual people. No, no. We're more word people. Yes. So it's interesting now. I totally get the soundtrack of passages. That's, I love that phrase, first of all, but now to have this soundtrack of images along with it, yeah, that's a real enhancement of your life. And I mean, again, deepening your whole five senses journey. That's, I mean, what's funny is you already wrote the book on the five senses and now you're discovering this whole other thing. Yeah. And it's something that I would never have, I mean, it may be people who are artists experience this all the time. Like maybe they constantly, just like things are flashing through and references and illusions and reenactments and seeing things, I'm sure that they do. Yeah, of course. But I would never have thought that it, I would never even, I just would never even have even occurred to me as to be something. So it was just, it's just been startling to have it happening. It's like the slideshow is just starting to go. Well, I wanna hear, I wanna keep up to date on that. I wanna hear about it, cause that's fascinating. It's super fun. And now for a spotlight on a tool. This is a new premium feature in the Happier app. Okay, the people who use the Happier app, there was the number one most requested feature. You asked, you got it.

Coming up, Gretch, there's something you've been meaning to tell me, but first, just break. This podcast is sponsored by eHarmony, the dating app that helps people find genuine connection. Gretch, I work with many people who use dating apps to meet someone, and there's a lot of frustration about how superficial it can be. It can be really hard to connect with someone on a deep level. In fact, eHarmony's Dating Diaries study found that 56% of social firsts genuinely meet. And 66% of social firsts, Gen Z, get tired of social media from time to time. So all of us who are in that camp are not alone. Well, one thing we talk about a lot is the value of knowing ourselves, and we love a good know yourself better quiz. And eHarmony has the compatibility quiz. It identifies a baseline of compatibility with questions about communication styles, likes and dislikes, personality, and more, so you get an insight into the type of person you're compatible with. So join the dating app that gets to know their users better so they can match better and see for yourself. Take eHarmony's compatibility quiz today and get someone who gets you.

Okay, listen, there's been something I've been meaning to tell you. I got the biggest kick out of that image from the picket line that you sent the other day, the one of Jon Hamm. Yes, so I sent you this. Now, I wish I could say I saw this in person. I did not, I miss Jon Hamm on the picket line. I think he was at Disney, and I go to Disney a lot, but I did not see him, which makes me sad because you know how much I love Jon Hamm. But there's a great picture of him, and he's holding a picket sign that says, that's what the money is for. And that is a famous line from Mad Men that both you and I love. Yeah, listen, when I saw this, I was just like, we went through this whole Mad Men thing together, and that is one of the most iconic lines. Yeah, so Gretchen, Jon Hamm plays Don Draper, and he is Peggy's boss, Peggy, played by Elizabeth Moss. And they have this scene together in one of the most famous episodes of Mad Men called The Suitcase, which is also one of my favorite episodes of television ever. So good. And Peggy is feeling resentful that Don won an award for an idea that she originally had for a commercial. Let's hear it. That's the way it works. There are no credits on commercials. But you got the Clio. It's your job. I give you money, you give me ideas. You never say thank you. That's what the money is for. So, I mean, Jon Hamm has got the sign that says that's what the money is for. That's what the whole strike is about. That's what the money is for. Yes, it's like we do this, and we deserve to get paid for it. Just like Peggy got paid for what she did. And if anybody wants to see the picture of Jon Hamm with his picket line sign, I will post it in the show notes. Now, Gretchen, I will say in a little bit of hopeful news that as of now, the WGA and the AMPTP are negotiating again. Finally, they've come back to the table after months of refusing to negotiate with us. So I'm feeling hopeful that maybe the end is in sight. And I believe we have discussed how now SAG-AFTRA is on strike also, which is why Jon Hamm is picketing, aside from just support of WGA. And so hopefully if we make a deal, it will very much facilitate SAG-AFTRA making a good deal as well. Oh, well, gosh, that is hopeful news. Yes. And I just wanna say again, Gretchen, how much everybody appreciates all the support that the unions have gotten from the Hollywood community, but also really from people across the country. So it is very much noticed and appreciated. Yeah, it's a wonderful thing. Yes. Okay, Gretchen, what is our quotation this week? Okay, this is Virginia Woolf from her essay, \"'How Should One Read a Book?' And she's describing the kinds of thoughts that we have as we stroll through a room full of books. How am I to read these books? What is the right way to set about it? There are so many and so various. My appetite is so fitful and so capricious. What am I to do to get the utmost possible pleasure out of them? And is it pleasure or profit? Or what is it that I should seek?\" I think we all can relate to that. So, Elizabeth, are you feeling more happier? Yes, I am feeling more happier, absolutely. Thank you, Chuck.

The second best time is now. Elizabeth, I really want to see pictures of the Corgis on vacation. I want to see a picture of you and Adam and Jack too, but I really, I'm just picturing the Corgis like sauntering around. With sunglasses and like parasols. Yes, I will have to do a great sort of photo essay of Nacho and Daisy take Carmel. Oh, I know, it's the picture book you can write. Yes, exactly. From the Onward Project.

Elizabeth is excited about a short getaway she is planning with her dogs. She found a dog-friendly hotel in Carmel, California, which is known as one of the most dog-friendly cities in the country.

Later in the podcast, Gretchen talks about her daily visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which she initially thought might become burdensome. However, she now loves every moment of her time at the museum and finds it to be a delightful recess from her daily routine. She also shares a surprising development where she now has visual images from the Met flashing through her mind, much like the quotations she constantly has running in the back of her mind. Key moments: - Elizabeth is excited about a dog-friendly getaway she is planning in Carmel, California. - Gretchen loves reading same-day books and recently enjoyed reading \"The Sundial\" by Shirley Jackson. - Gretchen finds her daily visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to be a delightful recess and is surprised by the visual images from the Met that are now flashing through her mind."}
