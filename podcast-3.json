I'm your host Cory Mascara and in today's episode we're going to talk about a different way to think about letting go. More to come on that in a moment. First let's settle in together with the sound of the bells. Okay so I want to start with a provocative statement and that statement is if you want to let go you must fall in love with the part of you that is holding on. If you want to let go you must fall in love with the part of you that is holding on. This is typically a hard thing for us to understand mainly because the part of us that is holding on regardless of what it is, a relationship, a past identity, a job, just anything you want to transition from but feel stuck in a loop around. We often feel like that part is hurting us, creating suffering and in some cases ruining our life. If only I could just let go what's wrong with me? Why can't I do this? It should be easy. We try to will our way into release and anyone who's tried to do that knows it doesn't really work too well or you temporarily suppress the holding on or force yourself into like a pseudo form of release where you just put all of your energy where you're trying to go but it's mainly a fighting the part of you that's holding on and you're trying to block that out block that out but it's not a real letting go and this is where you will often relapse into the holding on. And so where does loving that part come in? Well we have to understand why the holding on is happening in the first place and the reason a part of us would hold on is because it's afraid it's going to lose something if it lets go. That something can take a lot of different forms but I am going to reduce it to love. It can also be safety, it can be security, it can be predictability, it can be a life you want but even if you reduce that further it can all sort of be encapsulated in love and to even further understand that just think about the moments where you've just felt the deepest most open love. Everything else is taken care of. Safety you're not really thinking about that, security you're not really thinking about that. It's all just like it's all taken care of in the field of love and so we could say that the part that is holding on its greatest fear is that it's going to lose love or not get love or not achieve love at some point in the future if it lets go. So that's a really important thing to know. That's its positive intention that's what it's trying to give you and so when I say if you want to let go yeah you must fall in love with the part of you that is holding on it starts to make a little bit more sense where I might be going with this and that is that that part needs to know that it's going to get the thing that it most wants or at the very least there'll be other ways to get it and by showing love to that part you're giving it the very nutriment that it fears it will lose if it's not doing the thing holding on that is causing you so much distress and you know you can think about this in your own life you know different things that were important to you or that you worked really hard for or maybe a time in your life where you were just like grinding grinding grinding thinking that's gonna be the thing and then maybe you fell in love or you had a certain awakening and just those things before just didn't they didn't feel as important and you could say oh well you know it's a form of losing my edge yeah I would put that as a form of you found something more essential you found the thing that you were really looking for and then all these other strategies you were employing just no longer seemed necessary or they could take a different shape so when we show that part love when we fall in love with it when we let it know that we appreciated that we're here for it and we just let it be held in the field of our love well it it's getting that thing and in the same way that your priorities might shift or you might let go of different things when you finally get the thing that you're looking for that part will begin to let go because it doesn't feel like it has to grasp so desperately to try to get it because it's already here it's being offered it's being given and it's being reassured and so when you're in your letting go and surrender process this is a really important thing to show yourself because most of the time we're trying to go about things like let letting go and surrender from a place of force or will or even just cognitively like think through all the reasons why this should be okay and it's not getting to the heart of the thing and so now if you want a simple way to do this just you know go on a date with that part of you get to know it say it's just you and me and I just want to take this time to appreciate you you don't even need to you know use it in a manipulative way just like I just want to take this time to appreciate all the ways that you've been helping me and talk to it in that way it's an appreciation love fest and see what softens in your system when you meet that part that you most likely most resent with a totally different orientation it might take some time for that part to really feel that and take it in but I imagine you're gonna feel pretty immediate shift at least in terms of just the ease that comes in your system thank you for your practice talk to you soon and until next time take care"}, "podcast_summary": "In this podcast episode, the host emphasizes the importance of falling in love with the part of ourselves that is holding on to something and preventing us from letting go. Often, we perceive this part as causing us suffering and hindering our progress. However, the host suggests that this part is actually trying to protect us from losing something, usually love. By showing love and appreciation to this part, we reassure it that it will still receive what it desires, alleviating the need to hold on tightly. The host encourages listeners to go on a \"date\" with this part of themselves, expressing gratitude and acknowledging its efforts. This shift in perspective can lead to a noticeable ease and a true process of letting go and surrendering.", "podcast_guest": "Cory Mascara", "podcast_highlights": "Summary:\nIn this episode of Practicing Human, Cory Mascara discusses a different perspective on letting go.
